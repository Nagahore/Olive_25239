This Flutter code defines a simple calculator app with a user interface featuring buttons for numbers (0-9), basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=). The app maintains a list (inputList) to keep track of the numbers and operators as they are pressed, and displays the current input and result in a text field. When a user presses a button, the _handlePress method updates the list and output string accordingly, while _handleClear resets the calculator. The calculator performs operations sequentially from left to right when the equals button is pressed, handling basic arithmetic and avoiding division by zero. The app uses a GridView to layout the buttons and updates the display based on user input.
